"""Replacement requests functions.

The get(), post(), put() and delete() functions in this module can be used as
a drop-in replacement for the ones in python-requests. These functions
optionally accept relative URLs (for example /api/users), which are sent to
the load balancer configured for the service. The functions also implement
retries.
